# Weather Insights Dashboard 🌦️

## 📌 Problem Statement
Access to weather and air quality data is often fragmented across multiple sources, making it difficult for individuals to plan their daily activities and assess potential health risks.  
There is a need for a unified, easy-to-use dashboard that combines **real-time weather conditions, air quality metrics, and environmental indicators** in one place.

## 🎯 Solution
This interactive Power BI dashboard integrates **real-time API data** to present:
- Current weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind, pressure, etc.)
- Air Quality Index (AQI) with pollutant-level breakdowns (PM2.5, PM10, O₃, CO, NO₂, SO₂)
- Forecast trends and rain probabilities
- Sunrise & sunset timings

## 💡 Impact
- Provides **actionable insights** for users to make informed decisions about outdoor activities.  
- Raises awareness about **air pollution exposure** and its health implications.  
- Helps individuals, communities, and organizations track **environmental conditions in real time**.
